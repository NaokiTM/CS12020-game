# CS12020 Arduino space invader clone

assessed uni project I made using arduino C. The game emulates space invaders, and has features such as speeding up obstacles when the player hits a red obstacle, slowing down when hitting a green obstacle, and includes a pause state to allow the user to pause the game.
